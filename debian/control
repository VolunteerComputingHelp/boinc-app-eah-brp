Description: BOINC extension for Einstein at Home binary pulsar search
 BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) is a volunteer
 project to have regular citizens help with their compute power to address
 large scientific challenges. To contribute, please see the home pages
 of the BOINC project for details and follow the links to the respecitve
 page of the scientific project.
 .
 This package provides an executable for the Binary Pulsar Search
 subproject of the Einstein@Home project. Regular users would
 auto-download that executable via the BOINC-Client application or
 the BOINC-Manager. This package provides the equivalent binary but
 compiled on the Debian build demons. As such it is available to many
 more platforms than what could possibly be provided by the scientists
 themselves. Also, recompiling the package is likely to yield an
 executable well-optimized for the local machine that outperformes
 the official executable.
 .
 Quite some also run the Debian-provided packages for security concerns.
 They already decided to trust the Debian community and appreciated
 that executable to ship with an inspectable source tree.
